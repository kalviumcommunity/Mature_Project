Project Title: Incidents

Project Overview:
A platform where users can share various incidents from their lives. Users can vote on each other's incidents, and the ones with the most votes rise to the top of the leaderboard. The platform features different categories of incidents (e.g., horror, funny, embarrassing) represented as "rooms" in the navigation bar. Users can click on a specific room (e.g., "Horror Incidents") to share or explore stories related to that category.

Key Features:
Incident Sharing:

Users can share incidents from their lives by posting stories with titles, descriptions, and optional images.

Leaderboard:

A dynamic leaderboard displays the top-voted incidents, ranked by the number of votes they receive.

Reactions:

Users can react to incidents (e.g., upvote, downvote, or use emojis like ðŸ˜±, ðŸ˜‚, or ðŸ¤¯).

Comments:

Users can comment on incidents to share their thoughts, ask questions, or engage in discussions.

Incident Categories (Rooms):

Incidents are organized into different categories (e.g., Horror, Funny, Embarrassing) represented as "rooms" in the navigation bar.

Users can click on a specific room to view or share incidents related to that category.

User Profiles:

Users can create profiles, view their posted incidents, and track their votes and comments.

Search and Filter:

Users can search for incidents by keywords or filter by categories, popularity, or date.
